                    What is the difference between Virtualization and Containerization?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    1. The advantage of multiple copies: one of the major points that differentiate these two processes is
                    containers’ temporary behavior. Many copies of a container can exist at the same time in a system like
                    orchestration. If any containers failed, one can remove that and replace it, and there will be no change
                    or impact on service. Older versions can exist at the same time with the new versions. Removal and
                    replacement of the new versions can be done easily if any operation gets failed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Scaling related workloads: There is a vast difference between the scalability of a containerized
                    workload and a virtual workload. The containers contain only those services which are basic in nature
                    and which their functions require, but among those services, one can be a web server like Nginx and
                    virtualization workload system, like cabernets, having the capability of judging that when there is a
                    need of scaling out the number of containers based on the sequence of traffic follows and can copy the
                    images of the container on its own and also remove them from the system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Foundation for running an application: the Linux containers format is the foundation for
                    containerization format. So, containerization can only run the Linux application as it will support only
                    the Linux environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. Using microservices architecture: Google firstly uses the architecture “microservices” and then by
                    Netflix. One can operate these systems without excluding any single application. In the form of
                    functions, they perform small workloads that may be contacted through API, and they perform different
                    functions. These functions can be seen in traditional applications, although many applications can
                    perform the same functions on repeat.

                    Containerization vs Virtualization: Which one is better!
                </h3>
                <p class="lead mb-4">
                    The assurance of which is better in Containers versus Virtual Machines (VMs) relies upon your objective.
                    However, virtualization empowers remaining tasks at hand to keep running in situations that are isolated
                    from their basic equipment by a layer of reflection. This reflection enables servers to be separated
                    into VMs that can run distinctive working frameworks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Container innovation offers an elective strategy for Virtualization, in which a solitary working
                    framework on a host can run a wide range of users from the cloud. One approach to consider Containers
                    versus VMs is that while VMs run a few distinctive working frameworks on one process hub, while
                    containers offer the chance to virtualize the working framework itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Containerization and Virtualization differ in many ways, but the primary difference is that containers
                    provide a way to virtualize an OS to run multiple workloads in a single OS instance. With VMs, the
                    hardware is virtualized to run multiple OS instances. The speed, agility, and portability of the
                    container make it another tool to streamline software development.
